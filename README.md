# UrbanSeg
This is a final project for the course Computational Visual Recognition. The code is composed using PyCharm.

# Acknowledgement:
1. We used the SegNet model and the metrics (calculating IoU) from https://github.com/meetshah1995/pytorch-semseg since we found it having straight forward implementation from Pytorch forum.
2. We used https://github.com/ZijunDeng/pytorch-semantic-segmentation as a reference to write our dataloader. Large modification has been made to fit our case.
